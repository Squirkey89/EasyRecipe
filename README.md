# Easy Recipe

The aim of the project was to build a website using the Django framework. This is my fourth portfolio project. I chose to build a recipe website as I felt I would be able to design a high-quality website and could implement the features that I wanted to. I created a website called Easy Recipe. This website was designed to be a simple and user friendly website. The website's objective is to create a database of recipes that can be shared among users. The website is aimed at anyone who loves cooking and wants to learn about and share recipes. The website can also be useful for someone who is just learning how to cook.&nbsp;
